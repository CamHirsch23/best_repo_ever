# Question 3 
# Task 1 and Task 2

# Prices of individual items
price_bread = 2.50
price_peanut_butter = 3.75
price_jelly = 4.00

# Calculate total cost
total_cost = price_bread + price_peanut_butter + price_jelly

# Print the total cost
print("Total cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly is: $", total_cost)

# Initial amount and interest rate
principal = 10000
interest_rate = 0.07

# Calculate total amount after a year
total_amount = principal + (principal * interest_rate)

# Print the total amount
print("Total amount in the account after a year is: $", total_amount)
